üå≥üîç Thrilled to share my latest project in data science: Forest Cover Type Prediction!
I‚Äôm diving into the world of forestry data, leveraging machine learning to predict forest cover types. 

‚û° This data set involves Id, Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Horizontal distance to hydrology, Vertical distance to hydrology, Soil type, Cover type where various features are used to classify land into different cover types.

‚û°The first step involved importing essential libraries like NumPy and Pandas and reading the data to understand the dataset. This project is a perfect blend of environmental science and data analytics.

‚û°I checked the dataset information using df.info(), counted null values using df.isnull().sum(), and identified duplicated values using df.duplicated().sum(). I examined the statistical summary of the data with the describe() function.

‚û°I used sklearn.model_selection to split the dataset into training and testing sets. I then applied the StandardScaler to fit and transform the training data, and transform the testing data.

‚û°Following this, I employed Logistic Regression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier to build and evaluate different models. To ensure robust evaluation, I utilized ShuffleSplit for cross-validation.

‚û°With the models trained, I imported the pickle library to save the model having the highest accuracy.
 
‚û°Finally, I used PIL to import images and Streamlit to deploy the model, making it accessible for real-time predictions.

‚û°Once deployed, users can input data values, and the app predicts the forest cover type based on the provided factors.
